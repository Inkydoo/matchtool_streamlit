178,178,"Since 4 October, the Myanmar Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) has been issuing flood advisory warnings and weather system alerts for the water levels of major rivers. From 5 to 9 October, heavy rainfall in the late monsoon season, triggered extensive flooding in southern Myanmar. 

On 9 October, Bago township experienced an unprecedented 7.87 inches (200 millimetres) of rainfall, the highest recorded in 59 years. On 10 October, Bago River water level reached 4 feet above the danger level which caused widespread flooding in urban and sub-urban areas. The impact of this flooding has been significant. It has affected families and croplands and led to the displacement of people in areas from Bago City and Yangon, including the townships of Taik Kyi, Hlegu, and Hmawbi. Currently, there is limited data on needs and sectors relating to the requirements of the affected population. However, food, water, basic household needs, hygiene and sanitation are immediate needs by looking at current flood impact, pre-existing vulnerabilities and complexity of the country as well as a request from MRCS regional branches.

By looking at the level of a flood, the density of the population and based on initial data as well as preexisting vulnerability data, it can be expected that likely result in direct needs related to essential household, food, drinking water, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), livelihoods and health support. The overall impact will be known once needs are determined following the completion of the rapid needs assessment.

Existing data shows that multidimensional variables influence the level of vulnerability of most flood-affected townships including poverty incidence and shelter construction typologies. For instance, a higher number of pre-existing vulnerable populations is much higher in Bago which also has poor housing structures i.e. houses with light roofs/walls and huts/salvaged material, construction typologies most vulnerable to extreme weather events.

309,309,"In the early morning of Saturday, 15 April 2023, Khartoum woke up to the sound of gunfire and explosions. This was the first time that the capital city of Sudan, home to 6 million people, was at the epicentre of a fierce conflict between two powerful groups, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). 

Clashes broke out in different areas of the country and the relentless urban conflict has now taken at least 459  lives, many of them civilians, and injured over 5,000 people. 

Millions of civilians caught in the crossfire have been in lockdown for nearly two weeks, and many have run out of basic supplies like food, water, and medicine, having instead to borrow them or take the risk of fleeing through extremely dangerous routes. 

The conflict has also taken a significant toll on public infrastructure, with the destruction of hospitals and health facilities, leaving only 16 percent  of these facilities operating regularly in Khartoum. Residential buildings, water infrastructure, and energy infrastructure have been damaged as well, with continued disruption of service, while communications and internet connectivity have also been compromised. Both private and public facilities have been ransacked, and some burnt down, including on the premises of SRCS.  

The latest ceasefire has partially held, allowing evacuations to take place and some families to restock. However, food and water shortages, and lack of fuel, are leading to sharp increases in the cost of these basic commodities, while the price of transportation out of conflict areas is unaffordable for many. Families are prioritising the evacuation of women and children, who are exposed to heightened risks including sexual and gender-based violence, as reported by women-led organisations in Sudan . 

After 15 days of uninterrupted fighting, the full extent of the humanitarian situation is yet to be determined, but to date this conflict has put at least 9 million Sudanese, chiefly those living near the clashes, under severe hardship, unable to access emergency healthcare or medicines for those suffering from chronic conditions. The health facilities that remain functional lack staff and equipment, and the available blood is at risk due to power cuts in the cold chain. Women who are about to give birth cannot access ante-natal care and may be at risk of delivering without medical supervision. Lack of access to potable water is also leading people to seek water from the Nile, which could lead to a spike in diarrhoeal diseases, and will have repercussions on the nutrition status of children and pregnant and lactating women. 

Widespread displacement is ongoing, mainly in Khartoum, Northern State, North Kordofan, North Darfur, West Darfur, and South Darfur. There are chaotic scenes in Port Sudan and Wadi Halfa bordering Egypt, with people stranded for several days at a time attempting to leave the country. Displacement has also affected refugees living in Sudan, with many sheltering in crowded camps in White Nile State, Gedaref, and Kassala. People are also fleeing to neighbouring countries, including Chad, Egypt, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Central African Republic (CAR).",2023,22846,800000,National societies and IFRC,,459,9000000,2023-000066,5000,4,SDN,"Sudan, South Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, Central African Republic",,CE,15,CE-2023-000066

To date, it remains a crucial safe haven for 34,056 IDPs/civilians (source: DRC April 2021 population head count) who still perceive the security environment outside the PoC site as unsafe, with the PoC site continuing to serve as a critical coping mechanism for populations facing risk in Malakal and beyond.

As of March 2, 2023, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recorded again further increase of the disease. In total of 733 suspected cases, including 89 deaths (CFR 12.3%) with children between the ages of 5 and 18 are the age group most afflicted. The overall case fatality rate is (12.3). World Health Organization (WHO) latest data received from ProMed, reported that 20 states are currently reported suspected cases in Nigeria, with the majority of cases reported from Kano (74%), Yobe (12%), Katsina (6%), Sokoto (2%), Enugu ( 1%), Ogun ( 1%), Osun (1%), Kaduna (1%), Lagos (1%), and Zamfara (1%) states. Osun  and lagos state has high cases of zero dose children who are at risk of diphtheria. This outbreak has been labelled as one of the most recently severe outbreaks of diphtheria in Nigeria in recent years. 

Diphtheria is a disease that affects most people without the vaccine, and the NCDC reports that out of the suspected cases, only 27 (12.5%) out of 216 confirmed cases were fully vaccinated with a diphtheria toxin-containing vaccine. There have been laboratory-confirmed cases in addition to clinically suspected cases, and the NCDC is collaborating with state health departments and partners to improve surveillance and response to the outbreak. NCDC has been working with stakeholders to increase the awareness of the disease, however the cases continues to increase. 

NCDC was first notified of suspected diphtheria cases in Kano and Lagos states on December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) officially declared the situation as an outbreak of Diphtheria cases in Lagos and Kano States, which were the first to confirm Diphtheria cases. Diphtheria quickly spread to other states.

340,340,"The Savannah region bordering Burkina Faso has been plagued by incursions from non-state armed groups on the Burkinabe side of the border with several attacks since 2021. 
These attacks have multiplied since February, leading the Government on 17 February 2023 to request support from the CRT and its other partners for assistance to displaced populations. On that date, the death toll from the crisis was
- 102 dead and 15 injured.
- 2,037 displaced households, approximately 12,222 people including IDPs and Burkinabe populations.
* 1403 Burkinabe households in refuge in Togo.
* 634 internally displaced households.

New attacks continue to be recorded according to reports from branches on the ground. But access to information and data sharing remains an important challenge to define actions in real time. In addition, a certain degree of discretion at local level did not facilitate the clear identification of the number of displaced persons by the NS. In light of this, the CRT conducted a situation update mission, reporting 22,000 people affected by the crisis, including 8,857 IDPs including refugees and 13,861 host populations. 

The situation of the branches also shows that the villages attacked are mainly in the North East of the Savannah region and on the Burkinabe border, while the populations have found refuge in the more secure villages in the South of the Savannah region. The main places of refuge include: the Prefecture of Kpendjal in majority (Kpenjal- West in majority), the Prefecture of T&ocirc;ne, the Prefecture of Manjouar&eacute; (in the town of Majouar&eacute;), the Prefecture of Oti (mainly in Oti-Sud), and Cinkass&eacute; in the Savannes region.

The displaced are received daily by tens to hundreds in the above-mentioned localities. The current number of displaced persons is said to exceed the above figures by tens of thousands. The displaced persons are said to be fleeing from the attacks, but they are also fleeing following warnings within the communities of possible attacks, whether or not they are actually planned. The populations found refuge in host families in villages located more than 20 km from their original residences. 

Most of the population moved on foot or on carts with their few pieces of luggage, leaving behind their granaries, poultry and small ruminants. It should be remembered that the majority of these displaced persons arrived in host families without the minimum of facilities for their integration.  This forced the host families to share their food reserves with their hosts. Today, it is difficult to eat the 3 daily meals. The consumption of pets has started to increase.
Among the displaced there is a high percentage of children under 11 years old (about 30%) who are psychologically affected by the atrocities and the change of life. 
 
Access to the villages of origin to consider a return is no longer possible or at least remains a challenge as the security situation remains volatile with explosive devices buried on the roads. This is the case, where on 2 February, 10 people on board a tricycle fell victim to an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) at a place called Inamoufali. No survivors were noted as the convoy headed to the cemeteries to bury the four peasants murdered the day before.

346,346,"From January 7th to February 6th, 2023 the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea identified a cluster of deaths in two remote districts of the continental region of Equatorial Guinea (Nosrk Nsomo and Ebebiyim) where a total of 9 deaths occurred with similar symptoms related to viral hemorrhagic fever. Equatorial Guinea currently does not have laboratory capacity to test for VHF, hence samples from those who were sick and from close contacts were sent to Gabon and Senegal. The samples sent for testing in Gabon were negative, but the out of the eight samples sent to Dakar, Senegal, one tested positive for Marburg virus. 

On 13 February 2023, the Equatorial Guinea MoH officially declared the outbreak. (https://www.afro.who.int/countries/equatorial-guinea/news/equatorial-guinea-confirms-first-ever-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak) 

As of 17 February, 1 case is confirmed, 8 are probable (deaths from individuals with VHF symptoms that were not tested) and 16 suspect cases in isolation (2 are showing signs and symptons). 21 additional are considered secondary contacts. There is restricted access to Kie Ntem district, with an estimated 4,235 people in quarantine.  

The affected district is located in the north-east of Equatorial Guinea mainland, bordering Cameroon and Gabon. Several suspected cases were identified in Cameroon, but all samples were negative for Marburg virus. There is no notification of cases or symptoms related to Marburg on the Gabonese territory.

Marburg Virus Disease (MVM) is a highly virulent disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, with a case fatality rate of up to 88%. It belongs to the same family of viruses that causes Ebola virus disease. The disease caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with a high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days. The virus is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the body fluids of infected people, surfaces and materials. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the virus. However, supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival.

The Marburg outbreak declared on 13 February 2023 is the first VHF outbreak in Equatorial Guinea. At present, the epidemiological situation is as follows: 
•	1 case confirmed, 9 deaths (8 probable cases, 1 confirmed), 16 suspect cases in isolation, 2 of those in isolation are showing signs and symptoms. 21 are considered “secondary contacts” and in isolation at home.  
•	Estimated 4,325 people in quarantine and restricted access to Kie Ntem District. 
However, given the low levels of contact tracing, the reduced number of samples collected, the lack of testing capacity in country, the time required to collect and send samples to other countries, and the delays in obtaining results, these numbers may not reflect entirely the reality of the outbreak. The attack rate is also considerably high, at 23% for relatives and 81% for those providing direct care to infected persons when precautions are not strictly practiced. Moreover, case fatality ratios from past outbreaks have ranged from 24% to 88%, depending on the case management.  The above, associated with the time elapsed between the identification of the first symptoms (7 January) and the  confirmation of the virus (13 February), considerably heightens the potential of widespread infection, and poses challenges to the response and overall control of a very virulent outbreak. 

According to government information, initial alerts and deaths have been traced  back to public events which, according to local religious and cultural customs, bring together several dozen and sometimes hundreds of people. Untraced contacts in the community, rumours and lack of information within the communities could be an important transmission lever that needs to be managed urgently.

As the country approaches the wet season at the end of the year, much of the country is expected to receive above-average rainfall influenced by a La Ni&ntilde;a event. However, the New Guinea Islands region tends to be drier during La Ni&ntilde;a events and so chances of drought continuing in New Britain, New Ireland, Manus, and Bougainville is relatively high.

The explosion occurred in the basement of a three-floor shopping building, which is completely destroyed, and caused the infrastructure damages on the area of about 9,000 square meters comprising abundance of buildings used by local shop owners at the Surmalu market. A massive fire teared through the area with a plume of smoke spreading quickly following the blast.

The number of shops and stores in the affected area is unknown as the majority remained unregistered and unofficial micro-businesses; only around 20 shop owners are confirmed to have been registered, all of which are destroyed. 

The explosion is considered to have been triggered by a fire in the fireworks warehouse that started several minutes before the explosion; the Government of Armenia has indicated violation of norms and standards in the fireworks depot of the building as a possible cause of the explosion; however, this is yet to be confirmed upon the completion of the ongoing investigation. The emergency teams of the firefighting unit under the Ministry of Emergency&#39;s State Rescue Service were dispatched immediately to extinguish the fire; however, the explosion occurred before their arrival on site. 

The explosion has caused a widespread fear and panic among the population of Armenia due to the nature of explosive disasters being associated with terrorist attacks. The explosion was followed by subsequent recurring bomb alerts initiated at public spaces in Yerevan, such as metro and bus stations, which have contributed to increased fear and panic among the population.

Based on Statistics Committee &quot;Armstat&quot; data, the refugee-like population are likely to face increased rental expenses in the coming months. Given that the refugee-like population was already facing financial hardships before the winter season, having a hard time covering basic livelihood needs and trying to find a balance between such needs as utility payments, food and clothes, healthcare, and education costs, the imminent winter season will exacerbate those difficulties, precipitating a severe humanitarian crisis. It is also worth noting that while the host communities have played a critical role in welcoming the refugee-like population and providing shelter and livelihood support, their resources have been depleting as well.

1300,1300,"Currently, monthly migrant arrivals are, on average, more than two hundred fifty (250); a number which has been maintained, since April 2019.

This influx, which began during September 2018, has been progressively increasing at an alarming rate, surpassing all expectations/predictions in May 2019. Most of the new migrant arrivals up to June 2019 were men of Syrian origin. 

However, according to the UNHCR, since the 1st of June 2019, Turkey, following negotiations with the occupied areas ?authorities', introduced a visa requirement for all Syrians who wish to travel to the occupied areas of Cyprus. Therefore, the Syrians are now required to pay for a visa in order to enter the occupied areas of Cyprus from Turkey, which translates to a significant cost, as well as a long waiting period, and a possibility of rejecting their visa request.
 
For this reason, the number of migrants of Syrian origin diminished, while concomitantly the number of migrants of African origin increased. Indeed, according to UNHCR findings, African nationals enter the occupied areas to study in the Universities located there; however, they are tricked about the living conditions and job opportunities, while the recognition of their University degrees is questionable (Maren Wickwire: Manifest Media for Foreign Policy - https://city.sigmalive.com/article/2019/7/24/). Unable to survive and desperate to avoid exploitation, they are fleeing from the occupied areas to the areas controlled by the Government of Cyprus, seeking asylum. 
Stemming from the above, it is evident that the pattern of arrivals cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty and are not dependent on weather conditions.

On 17 January 2019, heavy rain fell on the north-eastern territories and the Argentine coast in the Chaco and Santa Fe provinces in the localities of Vilelas, Resistencia and Villa Minetti. These precipitation events generated large quantities of accumulated water, which had a more direct and stronger impact than prior rainfall due to the saturation of the soil; the rainfall prevented affected families from evacuating in time, causing increased damage to their homes. To address this situation, which has affected more than 9,000 people, the municipal government of Vilelas and local authorities from the provinces of Chaco and Santa Fe declared a water related emergency on 17 January and requested support from the national government. In addition, the Argentine Senate declared an agricultural emergency on 18 January 2019 for the entire Santa Fe region.

1427,1427,"A low-pressure area (LPA) on the southwest Pacific (east of Mindanao) is currently moving towards the Philippines with maximum wind speed of 35 km/h according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The LPA is forecasted to intensify into a tropical depression as it continues its west-northwest track towards Mindanao land mass. The weather disturbance is expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) between 18 and 19 January and is also expected to bring moderate to heavy rain over north eastern Mindanao and then traverse central Visayas. 

Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, heavy rainfall (greater than 7.5 mm per hour) is currently expected over Caraga Region (Region XIII), Davao Region (Region XI) and Eastern Visayas (VIII). The weather disturbance is expected to make landfall over the southern part of Davao region and traverse north through Caraga, Eastern Visayas up to Bicol region.

Caraga is particularly vulnerable as these are mountainous areas with river valleys and are susceptible to floods and landslides.  The current landfall is forecasted for Caraga Region,  Surigao del Sur Province located along the northeastern coast of Mindanao. Situated west is the Diwata Mountain Range, isolating the province from the rest of Mindanao. 

Caraga is susceptible to landslides due to its rugged terrain, while the Agusan River Valley (the third largest river basin in the country, with a total drainage area of 11,937 square kilometres and an estimated length of 390 kilometres from its head origin in Compostela Valley) that stretches all the way to Davao, Butuan and Surigao makes the region prone to flash floods. 

As the LPA moves closer, government authorities are likely to pre-emptively evacuate families living near the coast, riverbanks, landslide prone areas and other vulnerable places. The rain from the weather disturbance is expected to cause floods and landslides which is expected to cause casualties and damage to shelter, crops, livestock and livelihoods.

In addition, the communities in the upper area of the Sierra de Bahoruco's geographic location, which is adjacent to Haiti in the northern section of the Dominican Republic, has been affected by recurrent outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, thus putting the surrounding area at constant risk. The area's high vulnerability can be attributed to the regular passage of large numbers of people between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; this highly mobile population often does not seek care in the Dominican Republic before returning to Haiti (due to cultural and family ties), which could mean that the number of cases in the in the affected area exceeds current estimates.",2018,21157,0,IFRC,,0,0,2018-000145,0,9,DOM,,,EP,7,EP-2018-000145

According to the National Institute for Disaster Management (INGC), flooding this disaster season has cost the lives of 40 individuals and affected some 18,000 families (70,000 people) (News24 2017). Maputo and Gaza provinces, including the capitol of Maputo, have been the most affected areas of the country followed by Nampula and Sofala provinces. Most recently (14/15 January), flooding in Maputo city killed three people and displaced some 236 families. Additionally, authorities have reported that in recent days in Nampula and Sofala some 1,400 people have been affected by floods including six deaths and more than 200 family displacements (Verdade 2017).

On 18 January 2017, the Government activated a nation-wide institutional ?Orange Alert? following the release of medium-term forecasts by the National Meteorological Institute projecting the occurrence of heavy rains and strong winds across the country until March 2017. The decision was announced following a meeting of the Technical Council for Disaster Management and seeks to intensify the Government's monitoring and readiness actions to address the potential impacts of flooding and cyclonic events during the disaster season. The ?Orange Alert? is released in parallel to the ongoing ?Red Alert? issued in 2016 for the southern and central regions of the country to address the effects of the food insecurity situation brought on by the 2015/16 El-Ni&ntilde;o induced drought. 

At present, four river basins--Buzi and Pungue in the central region and Mutamba and Inhanombe in the southern region?are at ?alert? level and are expected to breach within the next 72 hours. The breach of these river basis is expected to cause floods in Govuro (North of Inhambane Province) and in Machanga (South of Sofala Province).

According to local media and residents, events of similar magnitude occurred in 1939 and 1978.  

Heavy rainfall has been recorded since early this year in many parts of the country; most of which have been ""sudden and with abundant accumulations of water"", causing complications at the local level in places such as the provinces of Santa Fe, Cordoba, Buenos Aires and Jujuy.

One of the most affected localities is Volc&aacute;n, the capital of Tumbaya department, which is located 41 km north of the city of San Salvador de Jujuy, the provincial capital. The mud and stones that slid down a hill near this town affected 90 per cent of the community's homes and blocked National Route 9, leaving the population with no access over land. In some areas, mud levels reached 2.2 metres, which led to the evacuation of 296 people, who are currently being housed in 3 temporary collective centres: Parador Laguna, a local church and a National Roads building. One person has been reported missing.
Tumbaya, located 7 km north of Volc&aacute;n (48 km from San Salvador de Jujuy) on National Route N? 9, suffered damage from the landslides and severe flooding, where water levels rose as high as 1.20 metres. The population here is approximately 500 people, of which 150 people (30 per cent of the total population) have been affected. Of these, ten families (about 50 people) had to be evacuated. The only land access to the area from the south on foot until traffic can be resumed over the lone access road (National Route N? 9); however, the area can be supplied from cities located to the north of the province such as Tilcara, as access to those areas is still possible. 

The town of B&aacute;rcena, with a population of 158 people, is located 10 km south of Volc&aacute;n (31 km north of San Salvador de Jujuy); this entire area has been affected. A total of 100 people have been evacuated, of which 15 are being housed at Mountain Infantry Regiment (RIM 20) facilities, while others were transported to San Salvador de Jujuy. Due to the suddenness of the landslide, two people lost their lives while travelling through the town along National Route 9.

The communities of Leon, Santa Barbara, Purmamarca, Humahuaca and San Mart&iacute;n, located north of the landslide in Volc&aacute;n, were hit by flash floods during this same period; local authorities have assisted the affected families

Currently, these communities are without communication, electricity and public services (water and sanitation). In regard to the electrical supply, the government estimates that it could be restored back to normal within the next 48 hours in some areas; however, no estimated time has been given for restoring the drinking water supply and sewage services. Local access to health (emergency services, health centres) is practically impossible due to the mud in the streets, as well as to the damage suffered by the physical facilities that provided these services.

1842,1842,"On 25 and 26 December 2016, more than 20 locations in the provinces of Buenos Aires, C&oacute;rdoba and Santa Fe were affected by intense rainfall which was accompanied by hail and strong electrical activity. The fact that these were low-lying areas, the soil's saturation and the presence of crevices in basins (the most important in Argentina) caused by the constant rainfall throughout the year led to significant flooding and overflows from rivers and streams. The localities affected in this province by this emergency in this period were not affected by the rainy season in 2015 and 2016.
Pergamino, a city in northern Buenos Aires province was one of the most affected by the rainfall, receiving some 220 millimetres of water in 4 hours, causing the Pergamino Stream, its tributaries and effluents, such as Chu Creek, to overflow. This led to flooding throughout the city, which is organized into 24 urban and peri-urban neighbourhoods. The flooding, mainly impacted riverside neighbourhoods (the river cuts across the city) such as 9 de Julio, Cueto, Centenario, Tocha, San Vicente, Kennedy, Centro, 27 de Noviembre, Belgrano, Mart&iacute;n M. de G?emes and Jos&eacute; Hern&aacute;ndez (the latter three are considered informal settlements); and Jorge Newbery (also an informal settlement) along Chu Creek, affecting 13,650 people, i.e. around 11 per cent of the total population. Basic services such as power, telephony, internet and water were partially interrupted for some 36 hours (completely in affected neighbourhoods), and some stretches of National Routes 8 and 9 (the main access roads to Pergamino) were blocked completely by flooding, making it difficult to mobilize assistance from outside of the city.

More than 3,400 homes have been flooded (between 30 and 220 cm of water), forcing families to leave their homes as access is only possible by boat or some 4-wheel drive vehicles. According to Civil Defence reports, around 50 residents have refused to self-evacuate or be evacuated and remain on the roofs of their homes, and approximately 250 are being housed in four collective centres. At the family / individual level, in addition to some medical emergencies and health complications associated with the emergency (injuries, blood pressure issues, etc.), families have reported the loss of household items (furniture, appliances, household goods, bedding, etc.) and sanitation issues such as garbage, waterlogged structures, vermin, vectors. These issues have been exacerbated by the meteorological conditions that are typical for this time of year, such as mean temperatures above 24? C (with highs above 32? C), high humidity, unstable weather conditions and the pre-existing pollution of the Pergamino Stream.

In addition to partial structural damage to dwellings and some public buildings (Primary Health Care Centres [CAPS] in G?emes and Jos&eacute; Hern&aacute;ndez neighbourhoods), the blocks adjacent to the Pergamino Stream have large amounts of accumulated debris and waste, which have been hard to remove because of the difficulty in accessing these streets. While the city does have a Local Response Plan, it failed to fully anticipate the storm's effects, catching a great number of families by surprise in their homes. On 25 December, the city formally declared a state alert, including a health alert, due to the level of impact suffered.

In Cordoba Province, the strong storm that hit the area on 26 December caused damage to electrical and water services and forced 100 people to evacuate in Jovita. Twelve homes were damaged by hail, and electrical services were interrupted in La Cumbre and in La Falda due to high winds that damaged lamp posts. Six neighbourhoods suffered damage in Villa Dolores, 50 people had to self-evacuate and there were blocked roads and fallen lamp posts; additionally, the storm interrupted electrical and water services in Villa Giardini, Rio Ceballos, Salsipuedes, Agua de Oro, Jes&uacute;s Mar&iacute;a and Colonia Caroya. More than 200 people in Santa Fe Province were forced to evacuate. The cities of Rosario and Alvarez were the most affected, as overflowing channels left half of the city cut off and hindered the evacuation efforts. Provincial authorities reported up to one metre of water in dwellings, including the Volunteer Fire Department facilities, which had to be evacuated as well.

1943,1943,"Due to the current El Ni&ntilde;o effect, Timor Leste's annual rainy/wet season (which normally lasts from December to March) has been low - and delayed in some areas - leading to drought conditions in many parts of the country. A rapid assessment conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) estimates that at least 120,000 people have been severely affected across five districts (Baucau, Covalima, Lautem, Oecusse and Viqueque), with 45.9 per cent of households across the country likely to experience food insecurity from April to June. 

In addition to its effects on food security, the situation has resulted in water shortages and directly affected the livelihoods of thousands of people, especially rural and agriculture-dependent populations. Some communities that are experiencing sporadic rainfall are able to replant short-duration crops (as part of the second cropping period). However, the effects of El Ni&ntilde;o are largely affecting communities that are more reliant on livestock and single-season farming. The loss of livestock for many translates to the loss of their ?banked? wealth and will have an impact on the ability of such households to send their children to school and to pay other household expenses. Since livestock is also used for tilling the land, loss in livestock will make it harder for farmers to prepare their land for replanting.

Of the few people who managed to plant their fields, the crops are dying off due to this prolonged dry spell. These conditions have also negatively affected livestock conditions due to poor pastures and limited  availability of water. 

The prolonged dry spells and drought not only affected maize production but other crops such as sorghum, beans, peas and wheat have also been affected, and harvests are down and low yields are therefore expected.

during election periods. An agreement on a repatriation mechanisms protocol was signed in 1999 between the
Dominican Republic and Haiti; however, it was never implemented. A review of this protocol has been requested by
the Haitian government.
In the current environment, it is imperative that steps be considered in order to manage all cases that correspond to
the three categories of people identified as migrants and their descendants under Dominican law as:
- Group A: People born to foreign parents in the Dominican Republic and recorded in the civil status registries
and members of their families;
- Group B: Those born in the Dominican Republic, but who have never been recorded in the civil status
registries;
There is a third category, which consists of economic migrants in irregular situations:
- Group C: Immigrants in the Dominican Republic in irregular situations (mostly Haitian) are estimated at over
300,000 people, with around 250,000 who do not have documentation.
Currently, there are operations to deport irregular migrants operations (from 500 to 1,000 per week according to
information gathered from civil society organizations present at the border), and the deportations are mostly outside of
any established repatriation mechanism between the two countries. According to the reports, in addition to the four
official border crossings, hundreds of illegal crossing points are used, making the process of identification and the
provision of assistance to affected populations very difficult.

2035,2035,"Forest and land fires which occurred in some of the islands of Borneo (Kalimantan) and Sumatra resulted in a very dense haze, with conditions on the round getting more and more serious. The Centre for Health Crisis of Ministry of Health (CHC/MOH) reported that the forest fire which caused this haze started on 1 March 2015 in Riau Province. By now the affected area spread into six other provinces, four in kalimantan (West, East, South and Central Kalimantan) and three in Sumatra Island (Jambi, Riau and South Sumatera). In the last few weeks, the haze has also affected neighbouring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The intensification of this disaster is the consequence of El Nino in the region, with severe droughts and significant delay of the rainy season, therefore preventing the effect of the rain on forest fires.  

BMKG (National Meteorological, Climatology and Geophysics Agency) recorded the number of hotspots as 1,200 points spread in Sumatra and Borneo (where Kalimantan region is located). On the island of Sumatra, there are 771 hotspots spread across several provinces, including Bengkulu (33 points), Jambi (99 points), Bangka Belitung (41 points), Lampung (42 points), Riau (28 points), West Sumatra (8 points), and South Sumatra with 530 points.

Regrettably, the fire resulted in the loss of 42 lives, and it left a trail of destruction in its wake. Approximately 100 shelters within the Mae Surin refugee camp were consumed by the relentless flames. It is worth noting that this camp primarily served as a refuge for ethnic Karen refugees from neighboring Myanmar, who had fled the conflict between guerrilla forces and government troops.

The fire&#39;s impact was profound, not only in terms of human lives lost but also in terms of the displacement and suffering experienced by the vulnerable refugees who called this camp their temporary home.

This is a 32% increase compared with the immediate previous year. A total of 319,244 metric tonnes will be required to cover the cereal deficit that the country is facing. 

The figures documented by the ZIMVAC assessment are primarily rural households and do not include the urban households. As has become a trend in food insecurity, the severely affected provinces in terms of percentage of food insecure population are; Matebeleland North (40%), Matebeleland South (32%), Masvingo (32%) and Midlands (30%). Post-harvest losses account to 20-30% of grain losses. Below is a table highlighting the most affected provinces and districts.

Late onset of rainfall, pro-longed dry spells and erratic rainfall coupled with limited access to inputs account for the poor performance of the 2012/13 agricultural season. The ZIMVAC report also notes that levels of child severe acute malnutrition exceed the globally accepted rates (4.7% compared to  the global rate of 2%).  Zimbabwe Red Cross has decided to target Gwanda district which has a population of 112,267. The district was targeted because there is no other organisation responding to acute food insecurity in the district.  There are 24 operational wards with a total of 26,773 households.

Despite an International salvage response to refloat the vessel the situation has worsened over the past few days due to the adverse weather conditions.

The Rena has suffered substantial structure failure, with cracks appearing in the hull. This has been caused by the movement of the vessel as the stern, which has remained afloat, shifting with the waves, while the front part of the ship remains stuck on the reef.

Urgent aerial surveillance is required. Current weather conditions are hampering such operations. Suitable EOS applications are now required to assist in the detection of pollution. The owners of the ship are making every effort to minimise any further damages to the environment.

The country&#39;s Independent Electoral Commission had declared the opposition candidate Alassane Ouatarra the winner of the run off on 2 December 2010 but was overturned by the country&#39;s Constitutional Council which announced the incumbent President Gbagbo the winner though the international community including the UN recognized the victory of the opposition candidate. Since the two opposing candidates have taken oaths of office in different locations on 4 December 2010 and forming parallel governments in C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire, there have been protests in the country even before and after the presidential election run-off. The situation has affected movement of people and goods within the country thereby leading to increase in cost of living as prices of food ingredients have soared. The fear of violence has also led to the movement of some people into neighbouring Liberia and Guinea Conakry. An estimated 4,000 people had entered Liberia with new arrivals reported in villages along the border at a rate now of around 150 people per day. Meanwhile in Guinea, the number of newly registered Ivorian refugees in the southeast of the country is stable at some 186 people. As the political solution is being sought to the stalemate, there is the fear of increased population movement from C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire into Guinea, Liberia as well as Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mali to some extent in the coming days and this may lead to humanitarian needs in these countries.

A severe storm with a wind speed of 110 kmph accompanied by heavy rainfall preceded the cyclone ripping through the districts of Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hoogly. The coastal blocks like Sagar, Namkhana, Kakdwip and also Patharpraima, Canning, Basanti, Mathurapur and Kultali have all been severely affected and casualties have been reported. The West Bengal state?s Disaster Management Minister told BBC that 100,000 people had become homeless. The accompanying rains caused water-logging in large parts of the city, while power supply remained erratic and several flights were cancelled. Nearly four people were killed and 15 injured in Kolkata due to the storm that paralysed normal life. The usually bustling city streets were deserted since noon, as the authorities stopped tram services and asked people to stay indoors till evening.  

The city administration and police swung into action and virtual emergency was declared. Assistance of army has also been sought to help the civil administration in tackling the action.

Cyclonic storm AILA also paralysed life in several parts of Coastal Orissa triggering heavy rains and high velocity winds prompting government to gear up for relief work. No casualties have been reported so far.

According to the Regional Meteorological Centre Director, the cyclone now lying stationery 50 km west of Kolkata is moving in a northerly direction and will weaken gradually to a depression affecting the Northern and North Eastern states of India.

The rainstorm destroyed most of the houses made of mats/grass sheeting or timber, roofs of schools in the area blown off, the few household items owned by IDPs were blown away and latrines flooded. The available water sources were flooded resulting in further contamination by seawater; the price of clean water consequently doubled (from 50SDD to 100SDD).   Victims in certain areas ? mainly IDPs from South Sudan, Nuba mountains, Western Sudan, Eritrea and from within Red Sea state- are living in the open next to their destroyed homes.

The rain has also been insufficient to replenish much-needed water sources throughout the country and it is below the threshold for pasture regeneration.  All water catchments in the south are practically dry. 

The food security and livelihoods of 5,000 families (28,650 people) have been severely compromised by limited water and pasture.  Significant over-grazing of pasture and the depletion of water sources have contributed to widespread livestock deaths and a considerable decline in milk productivity.

7973,7973,"During the week of January 5-9, 1998, the eastern U.S. and eastern Canada were severely effected by a storm system with a very deep southerly flow and abundant moisture. This resulted in flooding rains from the lower Mississippi valley through the southeast and into the northeast, several tornadoes, and a severe ice storm in parts of the northeast/New England and into Canada. The death toll for the event:
Flood-related:
Tennessee--7
North Carolina--2
South Carolina--1
Kentucky--1
Alabama--1
Ice storm-related:
New York--9
Maine--5
New Hampshire--2

The heaviest rains and most severe flooding occurred in the mountains of North Carolina and northeast Tennessee, where up to 16 inches fell in a 2-day period. See below for some of the rainfall totals. Surveys indicate over 500 homes destroyed or with severe damage in North Carolina, and over 200 homes severely damaged or destroyed in Tennessee. Damages exceeded $15 million for western North Carolina and $20 million for eastern Tennessee. Tornado touchdowns produced some damage in Dublin, Georgia and Easley, South Carolina. Flooding also was a problem in parts of the lower Mississippi valley and upstate New York.

The severe ice storm mainly affected upstate New York, northern New Hampshire and Vermont, much of Maine, and southeast Canada. Some locations received over 3 inches of rain (as freezing rain), with radial ice thickness of one inch or more. Canada reported over 3 million utility customers without power immediately after the storm, while the northeast through New England reported over 500,000 customers without power. 80% of Maine's population lost electrical service.

8171,8171,"The May 18, 1980, eruption was the most destructive in the history of the United States. Novarupta (Katmai) Volcano, Alaska, erupted considerably more material in 1912, but owing to the isolation and sparse population of the region affected, there were no human deaths and little property damage. In contrast, Mount St. Helens' eruption in a matter of hours caused loss of lives and widespread destruction of valuable property, primarily by the debris avalanche, the lateral blast, and the mudflows.

Landscape changes caused by the May 18 eruption were readily seen on high-altitude photographs. Such images, however, cannot reveal the impacts of the devastation on people and their works. The May 18 eruption resulted in scores of injuries and the loss of 57 lives. Within the United States before May 18, 1980, only two known casualties had been attributed to volcanic activity - a photographer was struck by falling rocks during the explosive eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, in 1924; and an Army sergeant who disappeared during the 1944 eruption of Cleveland Volcano, Chuginadak Island, Aleutians. Autopsies indicated that most of Mount St. Helens' victims died by asphyxiation from inhaling hot volcanic ash, and some by thermal and other injuries.  Accurate cost figures remain difficult to determine. Early estimates were too high and ranged from $2 to $3 billion, primarily reflecting the timber, civil works, and agricultural losses. A refined estimate of $1.1 billion was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",1980,17682,0,USGS (http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/msh_may18_impact_aftermath.html),,0,0,1980-000002,0,5,USA,"Mt.

8182,8182,"This powerful, deadly, and destructive hurricane formed just west of the Cayman Islands on August 14. It rapidly intensified and by the time it reached western Cuba the next day it was a Category 3 hurricane. Camille tracked north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category 5 hurricane on August 16. The hurricane maintained this intensity until it made landfall along the Mississippi coast late on the 17th. Camille weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed Mississippi into western Tennessee and Kentucky, then it turned eastward across West Virginia and Virginia. The cyclone moved into the Atlantic on August 20 and regained tropical storm strength before becoming extratropical on the 22nd. A minimum pressure of 26.84 inches was reported in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which makes Camille the second most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States. The actual maximum sustained winds will never be known, as the hurricane destroyed all the wind-recording instruments in the landfall area. The estimates at the coast are near 200 mph. Columbia, Mississippi, located 75 miles inland, reported 120 mph sustained winds. A storm tide of 24.6 ft occurred at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast were about 10 inches. However, as Camille passed over the Virginias, it produced a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches. Most of this rain occurred in 3 to 5 hours and caused catastrophic flash flooding. The combination of winds, surges, and rainfalls caused 256 deaths (143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods) and $1.421 billion in damage.",1969,17687,0,National Hurricane Center (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/history.shtml#camille),,0,0,1969-000001,0,8,USA,"Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama",,TC,14,TC-1969-000001
